# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of our codebase seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT create a public issue** for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email us directly** at security@example.com with details
3. **Include the following information**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

## Security Measures Implemented

### üîí Container Security
- **Non-root user execution** (UID/GID 1001)
- **Read-only root filesystem**
- **Dropped Linux capabilities**
- **Security context enforcement**
- **Multi-stage builds** to minimize attack surface

### üõ°Ô∏è Kubernetes Security
- **Pod Security Standards** compliance
- **Network policies** for traffic isolation
- **Resource quotas** and limits
- **Security contexts** at pod and container level
- **Secrets management** for sensitive data

### üîç Vulnerability Management
- **Trivy security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependency updates** via Dependabot
- **Base image updates** on weekly schedule
- **Security patch management**

### üåê Application Security
- **Content Security Policy** (CSP) headers
- **HTTP security headers** (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **Secure cookie configuration**
- **HTTPS enforcement** in production

### üîÑ CI/CD Security
- **Secret scanning** in GitHub Actions
- **Signed commits** enforcement
- **Branch protection** rules
- **Automated security testing**
- **Secure artifact storage**
